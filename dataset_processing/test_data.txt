Question: what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Breast Cancer ?
Answer: Other screening tests are being studied in clinical trials.Thermography. Thermography is a procedure in which a special camera that senses heat is used to record the temperature of the skin that covers the breasts. A computer makes a map of the breast showing the changes in temperature. Tumors can cause temperature changes that may show up on the thermogram. There have been no clinical trials of thermography to find out how well it detects breast cancer or if having the procedure decreases the risk of dying from breast cancer. Tissue sampling. Breast tissue sampling is taking cells from breast tissue to check under a microscope. Abnormal cells in breast fluid have been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer in some studies. Scientists are studying whether breast tissue sampling can be used to find breast cancer at an early stage or predict the risk of developing breast cancer. Three ways of taking tissue samples are being studied:  Fineneedle aspiration: A thin needle is inserted into the breast tissue around the areola (darkened area around the nipple) to take out a sample of cells and fluid.  Nipple aspiration: The use of gentle suction to collect fluid through the nipple. This is done with a device similar to the breast pumps used by women who are breastfeeding.  Ductal lavage: A hairsize catheter (tube) is inserted into the nipple and a small amount of salt water is released into the duct. The water picks up breast cells and is removed. Screening clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the. NCI website.

Question: what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Breast Cancer ?

Question: What is (are) Colorectal Cancer ?
Answer: Key. Points. Colorectal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the colon or the rectum.  Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of death from cancer in the. United. States.Colorectal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the colon or the rectum.The colon is part of the body's digestive system. The digestive system removes and processes nutrients (vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and water) from foods and helps pass waste material out of the body. The digestive system is made up of the mouth, throat, esophagus, stomach, and the small and large intestines. The colon (large bowel) is the first part of the large intestine and is about 5 feet long. Together, the rectum and anal canal make up the last part of the large intestine and are 6 to 8 inches long. The anal canal ends at the anus (the opening of the large intestine to the outside of the body). Cancer that begins in the colon is called colon cancer, and cancer that begins in the rectum is called rectal cancer. Cancer that affects either of these organs may also be called colorectal cancer. See the following. PDQ summaries for more information about colorectal cancer:  Colorectal. Cancer. Screening  Colon. Cancer. Treatment  Rectal. Cancer. Treatment  Genetics of. Colorectal. CancerColorectal cancer is the second leading cause of death from cancer in the. United. States.The number of new colorectal cancer cases and the number of deaths from colorectal cancer are both decreasing a little bit each year. However, in adults younger than 50 years, the number of new colorectal cancer cases has slowly increased since 1998. The number of new colorectal cancers and deaths from colorectal cancer are higher in. African. Americans than in other races. Finding and treating colorectal cancer early may prevent death from colorectal cancer. Screening tests may be used to help find colorectal cancer.

Question: What is (are) Colorectal Cancer ?
Answer:  Colorectal cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the colon or the rectum. The colon and rectum make up the large intestine, which is the final part of the digestive system. Colorectal cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, especially in older adults. Risk factors for colorectal cancer include age, family history, diet, lifestyle factors, and certain genetic conditions. Symptoms of colorectal cancer may include changes in bowel habits, blood in the stool, abdominal discomfort, fatigue, and unexplained weight loss. Screening tests such as colonoscopy, fecal occult blood test, and virtual colonoscopy can help detect colorectal cancer early when treatment is most effective. Treatment for colorectal cancer may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Lifestyle changes such as eating a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, being physically active, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol can help reduce the risk of colorectal cancer.

Question: What is (are) Pancreatic Cancer ?
Answer: Key. Points. Pancreatic cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the pancreas.  Smoking and health history can affect the risk of pancreatic cancer.  Signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer include jaundice, pain, and weight loss.  Pancreatic cancer is difficult to detect (find) and diagnose early.  Tests that examine the pancreas are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage pancreatic cancer.  Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.Pancreatic cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the pancreas.The pancreas is a gland about 6 inches long that is shaped like a thin pear lying on its side. The wider end of the pancreas is called the head, the middle section is called the body, and the narrow end is called the tail. The pancreas lies between the stomach and the spine. The pancreas has two main jobs in the body:  To make juices that help digest (break down) food.  To make hormones, such as insulin and glucagon, that help control blood sugar levels. Both of these hormones help the body use and store the energy it gets from food. The digestive juices are made by exocrine pancreas cells and the hormones are made by endocrine pancreas cells. About 95% of pancreatic cancers begin in exocrine cells. This summary is about exocrine pancreatic cancer. For information on endocrine pancreatic cancer, see the. PDQ summary on. Pancreatic. Neuroendocrine. Tumors (Islet. Cell. Tumors) Treatment. For information on pancreatic cancer in children, see the. PDQ summary on. Unusual. Cancers of. Childhood. Treatment.

Question: How to diagnose Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma ?
Answer: Tests that examine the eye are used to help detect (find) and diagnose intraocular melanoma.The following tests and procedures may be used:  Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.  Eye exam with dilated pupil: An exam of the eye in which the pupil is dilated (enlarged) with medicated eye drops to allow the doctor to look through the lens and pupil to the retina. The inside of the eye, including the retina and the optic nerve, is checked. Pictures may be taken over time to keep track of changes in the size of the tumor. There are several types of eye exams:  Ophthalmoscopy : An exam of the inside of the back of the eye to check the retina and optic nerve using a small magnifying lens and a light.  Slitlamp biomicroscopy : An exam of the inside of the eye to check the retina, optic nerve, and other parts of the eye using a strong beam of light and a microscope.  Gonioscopy : An exam of the front part of the eye between the cornea and iris. A special instrument is used to see if the area where fluid drains out of the eye is blocked.  Ultrasound exam of the eye: A procedure in which highenergy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off the internal tissues of the eye to make echoes. Eye drops are used to numb the eye and a small probe that sends and receives sound waves is placed gently on the surface of the eye. The echoes make a picture of the inside of the eye and the distance from the cornea to the retina is measured. The picture, called a sonogram, shows on the screen of the ultrasound monitor.  Highresolution ultrasound biomicroscopy : A procedure in which highenergy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off the internal tissues of the eye to make echoes. Eye drops are used to numb the eye and a small probe that sends and receives sound waves is placed gently on the surface of the eye. The echoes make a more detailed picture of the inside of the eye than a regular ultrasound. The tumor is checked for its size, shape, and thickness, and for signs that the tumor has spread to nearby tissue.  Transillumination of the globe and iris: An exam of the iris, cornea, lens, and ciliary body with a light placed on either the upper or lower lid.  Fluorescein angiography : A procedure to look at blood vessels and the flow of blood inside the eye. An orange fluorescent dye (fluorescein) is injected into a blood vessel in the arm and goes into the bloodstream. As the dye travels through blood vessels of the eye, a special camera takes pictures of the retina and choroid to find any areas that are blocked or leaking.  Indocyanine green angiography: A procedure to look at blood vessels in the choroid layer of the eye. A green dye (indocyanine green) is injected into a blood vessel in the arm and goes into the bloodstream. As the dye travels through blood vessels of the eye, a special camera takes pictures of the retina and choroid to find any areas that are blocked or leaking.  Ocular coherence tomography : An imaging test that uses light waves to take crosssection pictures of the retina, and sometimes the choroid, to see if there is swelling or fluid beneath the retina.A biopsy of the tumor is rarely needed to diagnose intraocular melanoma.A biopsy is the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer. Rarely, a biopsy of the tumor is needed to diagnose intraocular melanoma. Tissue that is removed during a biopsy or surgery to remove the tumor may be tested to get more information about prognosis and which treatment options are best. The following tests may be done on the sample of tissue:  Cytogenetic analysis: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes.  Gene expression profiling : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are checked for certain types of. RNA. A biopsy may result in retinal detachment (the retina separates from other tissues in the eye). This can be repaired by surgery.

Question: How to diagnose Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma ?
Answer: To diagnose. Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma, the following steps may be involved: Comprehensive eye exam: This may include visual acuity testing, slitlamp examination, and dilated eye exam. Ultrasonography: Highfrequency sound waves are used to create images of the inside of the eye to detect abnormalities. Fluorescein angiography: A special dye is injected into the bloodstream to highlight blood vessels in the eye for examination. Optical coherence tomography (OCT): This imaging test uses light waves to create crosssectional images of the eye.

Question: What is the outlook for Wilms Tumor and Other Childhood Kidney Tumors ?

Question: What is (are) Breast Cancer ?
Answer: Key. Points. Breast cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the breast.  A family history of breast cancer and other factors increase the risk of breast cancer.  Breast cancer is sometimes caused by inherited gene mutations (changes).  The use of certain medicines and other factors decrease the risk of breast cancer.  Signs of breast cancer include a lump or change in the breast.  Tests that examine the breasts are used to detect (find) and diagnose breast cancer.  If cancer is found, tests are done to study the cancer cells.  Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.Breast cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the breast.The breast is made up of lobes and ducts. Each breast has 15 to 20 sections called lobes. Each lobe has many smaller sections called lobules. Lobules end in dozens of tiny bulbs that can make milk. The lobes, lobules, and bulbs are linked by thin tubes called ducts. Each breast also has blood vessels and lymph vessels. The lymph vessels carry an almost colorless fluid called lymph. Lymph vessels carry lymph between lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are small beanshaped structures that are found throughout the body. They filter substances in lymph and help fight infection and disease. Clusters of lymph nodes are found near the breast in the axilla (under the arm), above the collarbone, and in the chest. The most common type of breast cancer is ductal carcinoma, which begins in the cells of the ducts. Cancer that begins in the lobes or lobules is called lobular carcinoma and is more often found in both breasts than are other types of breast cancer. Inflammatory breast cancer is an uncommon type of breast cancer in which the breast is warm, red, and swollen. See the following. PDQ summaries for more information about breast cancer:  Breast.

Question: What is (are) Breast Cancer ?
Answer:   Breast cancer is cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts.

Question: What are the treatments for Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma ?
Answer: Key. Points. There are different types of treatment for patients with adult. Hodgkin lymphoma.  Patients with. Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers with expertise in treating lymphomas.  Patients may develop late effects that appear months or years after their treatment for. Hodgkin lymphoma.  Three types of standard treatment are used:  Chemotherapy  Radiation therapy  Surgery  For pregnant patients with. Hodgkin lymphoma, treatment options also include:  Watchful waiting  Steroid therapy  New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.  Chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant  Monoclonal antibody therapy  Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.  Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.  Followup tests may be needed.There are different types of treatment for patients with adult. Hodgkin lymphoma.Different types of treatment are available for patients with adult. Hodgkin lymphoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. For pregnant women with. Hodgkin lymphoma, treatment is carefully chosen to protect the fetus. Treatment decisions are based on the mothers wishes, the stage of the. Hodgkin lymphoma, and the age of the fetus. The treatment plan may change as the signs and symptoms, cancer, and pregnancy change. Choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team.Patients with. Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers with expertise in treating lymphomas.Treatment will be overseen by a medical oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating cancer. The medical oncologist may refer you to other health care providers who have experience and expertise in treating adult. Hodgkin lymphoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists:  Neurosurgeon.  Neurologist.  Rehabilitation specialist.  Radiation oncologist.  Endocrinologist.  Hematologist.  Other oncology specialists.Patients may develop late effects that appear months or years after their treatment for. Hodgkin lymphoma.Treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy for. Hodgkin lymphoma may increase the risk of second cancers and other health problems for many months or years after treatment. These late effects depend on the type of treatment and the patient's age when treated, and may include:  Acute myelogenous leukemia.  Cancer of the breast, bone, cervix, gastrointestinal tract, head and neck, lung, soft tissue, and thyroid.  Heart, lung, and thyroid disease.  Avascular necrosis of bone (death of bone cells caused by lack of blood flow).  Herpes zoster (shingles) or severe infection.  Depression and fatigue.  Infertility.  Hypogonadism (low levels of testosterone and estrogen). Regular followup by doctors who are expert in finding and treating late effects is important for the longterm health of patients treated for. Hodgkin lymphoma.Three types of standard treatment are used:Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. Combination chemotherapy is treatment with more than one anticancer drug. When a pregnant woman is treated with chemotherapy for. Hodgkin lymphoma, it isn't possible to protect the fetus from being exposed to the chemotherapy. Some chemotherapy regimens may cause birth defects if given in the first trimester. Vinblastine is an anticancer drug that has not been linked with birth defects when given in the second half of pregnancy. See. Drugs. Approved for. Hodgkin. Lymphoma for more information. Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat adult. Hodgkin lymphoma. For a pregnant woman with. Hodgkin lymphoma, radiation therapy should be postponed until after delivery, if possible, to avoid any risk to the fetus. If immediate treatment is needed, the woman may decide to continue the pregnancy and receive radiation therapy. However, lead used to shield the fetus may not protect it from scattered radiation that could possibly cause cancer in the future. Surgery. Laparotomy is a procedure in which an incision (cut) is made in the wall of the abdomen to check the inside of the abdomen for signs of disease. The size of the incision depends on the reason the laparotomy is being done. Sometimes organs are removed or tissue samples are taken and checked under a microscope for signs of disease. If cancer is found, the tissue or organ is removed during the laparotomy.For pregnant patients with. Hodgkin lymphoma, treatment options also include:Watchful waiting. Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment unless signs or symptoms appear or change. Delivery may be induced when the fetus is 32 to 36 weeks old, so that the mother can begin treatment. Steroid therapy. Steroids are hormones made naturally in the body by the adrenal glands and by reproductive organs. Some types of steroids are made in a laboratory. Certain steroid drugs have been found to help chemotherapy work better and help stop the growth of cancer cells. Steroids can also help the lungs of the fetus develop faster than normal. This is important when delivery is induced early. See. Drugs. Approved for. Hodgkin. Lymphoma for more information.New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the. NCI website. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant. Highdose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy and replacing blood forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After therapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells. The use of lowerdose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant is also being studied. Monoclonal antibody therapy. Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory, from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.

Question: What is (are) Laryngeal Cancer ?
Answer: Key. Points. Laryngeal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the larynx.  Use of tobacco products and drinking too much alcohol can affect the risk of laryngeal cancer.  Signs and symptoms of laryngeal cancer include a sore throat and ear pain.  Tests that examine the throat and neck are used to help detect (find), diagnose, and stage laryngeal cancer.  Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.Laryngeal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the larynx.The larynx is a part of the throat, between the base of the tongue and the trachea. The larynx contains the vocal cords, which vibrate and make sound when air is directed against them. The sound echoes through the pharynx, mouth, and nose to make a person's voice. There are three main parts of the larynx:  Supraglottis: The upper part of the larynx above the vocal cords, including the epiglottis.  Glottis: The middle part of the larynx where the vocal cords are located.  Subglottis: The lower part of the larynx between the vocal cords and the trachea (windpipe). Most laryngeal cancers form in squamous cells, the thin, flat cells lining the inside of the larynx. Laryngeal cancer is a type of head and neck cancer.

Question: What is (are) Laryngeal Cancer ?
Answer: Laryngeal. Cancer is a type of cancer that affects the larynx (voice box). Symptoms and diagnosis of laryngeal cancer may include:  Hoarseness or changes in voice. Sore throat. Difficulty swallowing. Ear pain. Persistent cough. Lump or swelling in the neck. CT scan or. MRI for diagnosis. Biopsy for confirmation of cancer

Question: what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors ?
Answer: New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.Information about clinical trials is available from the. NCI. Web site.Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the medical research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for disease are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way diseases will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their treatment.Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose disease has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop a disease from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the. Treatment. Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from. NCI's clinical trials database.

Question: What is (are) Atypical Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia ?
Answer: Key. Points. Atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia is a disease in which too many granulocytes (immature white blood cells) are made in the bone marrow.  Signs and symptoms of atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia include easy bruising or bleeding and feeling tired and weak.  Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery).Atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia is a disease in which too many granulocytes (immature white blood cells) are made in the bone marrow.In atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), the body tells too many blood stem cells to become a type of white blood cell called granulocytes. Some of these blood stem cells never become mature white blood cells. These immature white blood cells are called blasts. Over time, the granulocytes and blasts crowd out the red blood cells and platelets in the bone marrow. The leukemia cells in atypical. CML and. CML look alike under a microscope. However, in atypical. CML a certain chromosome change, called the "Philadelphia chromosome" is not there.

Question: What is (are) Atypical Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia ?
Answer: Atypical. Chronic. Myelogenous. Leukemia: Atypical. Chronic. Myelogenous. Leukemia (aCML) is a rare type of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm. It is characterized by abnormal growth of myeloid cells in the bone marrow and blood. Symptoms may include fatigue, weakness, fever, weight loss, and an enlarged spleen. Treatment options for aCML may include chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and stem cell transplant.

Question: What is (are) Nasopharyngeal Cancer ?
Answer: Key. Points. Nasopharyngeal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the nasopharynx.  Ethnic background and being exposed to the. EpsteinBarr virus can affect the risk of nasopharyngeal cancer.  Signs of nasopharyngeal cancer include trouble breathing, speaking, or hearing.  Tests that examine the nose and throat are used to detect (find) and diagnose nasopharyngeal cancer.  Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.Nasopharyngeal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the nasopharynx.The nasopharynx is the upper part of the pharynx (throat) behind the nose. The pharynx is a hollow tube about 5 inches long that starts behind the nose and ends at the top of the trachea (windpipe) and esophagus (the tube that goes from the throat to the stomach). Air and food pass through the pharynx on the way to the trachea or the esophagus. The nostrils lead into the nasopharynx. An opening on each side of the nasopharynx leads into an ear. Nasopharyngeal cancer most commonly starts in the squamous cells that line the nasopharynx. Nasopharyngeal cancer is a type of head and neck cancer.

Question: What is (are) Nasopharyngeal Cancer ?
Answer:  Nasopharyngeal cancer is a type of head and neck cancer that starts in the nasopharynx. Risk factors for nasopharyngeal cancer include being of. Asian descent, having a family history of the disease, and being infected with the. EpsteinBarr virus. Symptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer can include a lump in the neck, nosebleeds, hearing loss, and nasal congestion. Treatment for nasopharyngeal cancer may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or targeted therapy.

Question: What is the outlook for Ewing Sarcoma ?
Answer: Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery). The factors that affect prognosis (chance of recovery) are different before and after treatment. Before treatment, prognosis depends on:  Whether the tumor has spread to lymph nodes or distant parts of the body.  Where in the body the tumor started.  Whether the tumor formed in the bone or in soft tissue.  How large the tumor is at when the tumor is diagnosed.  Whether the. LDH level in the blood is higher than normal.  Whether the tumor has certain gene changes.  Whether the child is younger than 15 years.  The patient's gender.  Whether the child has had treatment for a different cancer before. Ewing sarcoma.  Whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back). After treatment, prognosis is affected by:  Whether the tumor was completely removed by surgery.  Whether the tumor responds to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. If the cancer recurs after initial treatment, prognosis depends on:  Whether the cancer came back more than two years after the initial treatment.  Where in the body the tumor came back.  The type of initial treatment given.

Question: What is the outlook for Ewing Sarcoma ?
Answer:  The outlook for. Ewing. Sarcoma depends on several factors, including: The size and location of the tumor. Whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. How well the tumor responds to treatment. The overall health and age of the patient. The specific genetic mutations present in the tumor. Whether the cancer has recurred or is newly diagnosed

Question: What are the stages of Metastatic Squamous Neck Cancer with Occult Primary ?
Answer: Key. Points. After metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.  There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.After metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.The process used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body is called staging. The results from tests and procedures used to detect and diagnose the primary tumor are also used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body. There is no standard staging system for metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary. The tumors are described as untreated or recurrent. Untreated metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary is cancer that is newly diagnosed and has not been treated, except to relieve signs and symptoms caused by the cancer.There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:  Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.  Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.  Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.

Question: What are the stages of Metastatic Squamous Neck Cancer with Occult Primary ?
Answer:  The stages of. Metastatic. Squamous. Neck. Cancer with. Occult. Primary are as follows: Stage 0: Cancer cells are found only in the lining of the throat. Stage. I: The cancer is found in the throat and nearby lymph nodes. Stage. II: Cancer has spread to other tissues in the throat or mouth, or to nearby lymph nodes. Stage. III: Cancer has spread to tissues near the throat, mouth, or lymph nodes in the neck. Stage. IV: Cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, such as the lungs or bones.

Question: What are the symptoms of Transitional Cell Cancer of the Renal Pelvis and Ureter ?
Answer: Signs and symptoms of transitional cell cancer of the renal pelvis and ureter include blood in the urine and back pain. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by transitional cell cancer of the renal pelvis and ureter or by other conditions. There may be no signs or symptoms in the early stages. Signs and symptoms may appear as the tumor grows. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:  Blood in the urine.  A pain in the back that doesn't go away.  Extreme tiredness.

Question: What is the outlook for Endometrial Cancer ?
Answer: Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:  The stage of the cancer (whether it is in the endometrium only, involves the uterus wall, or has spread to other places in the body).  How the cancer cells look under a microscope.  Whether the cancer cells are affected by progesterone. Endometrial cancer can usually be cured because it is usually diagnosed early.

Question: What is the outlook for Endometrial Cancer ?
Answer:  The outlook for endometrial cancer depends on several factors including the stage of the cancer, the grade of the tumor, and the patient's overall health. Early detection and treatment of endometrial cancer often result in a good prognosis. The fiveyear relative survival rate for localized endometrial cancer is around 95%. The survival rate decreases for more advanced stages of the disease, with distantstage endometrial cancer having a fiveyear relative survival rate of about 17%. Treatment options for endometrial cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and targeted therapy. Regular followup care and monitoring are essential to detect any signs of recurrence or progression of the disease.

Question: What are the stages of Oropharyngeal Cancer ?
Answer: Key. Points. After oropharyngeal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the oropharynx or to other parts of the body.  There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.  Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.  The following stages are used for oropharyngeal cancer:  Stage 0 (Carcinoma in. Situ)  Stage. I  Stage. II  Stage. III  Stage. IVAfter oropharyngeal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the oropharynx or to other parts of the body.The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the oropharynx or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The results of some of the tests used to diagnose oropharyngeal cancer are often used to stage the disease.There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:  Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.  Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.  Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.  Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.  Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if oropharyngeal cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually oropharyngeal cancer cells. The disease is metastatic oropharyngeal cancer, not lung cancer.The following stages are used for oropharyngeal cancer:Stage 0 (Carcinoma in. Situ) In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the lining of the oropharynx. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ. Stage. I. In stage. I, cancer has formed and is 2 centimeters or smaller and is found in the oropharynx only. Stage. II. In stage. II, the cancer is larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 4 centimeters and is found in the oropharynx only. Stage. III. In stage. III, the cancer is either:  4 centimeters or smaller; cancer has spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller; or  larger than 4 centimeters or has spread to the epiglottis (the flap that covers the trachea during swallowing). Cancer may have spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller. Stage. IV. Stage. IV is divided into stage. IVA, IVB, and. IVC:  In stage. IVA, cancer:  has spread to the larynx, front part of the roof of the mouth, lower jaw, or muscles that move the tongue or are used for chewing. Cancer may have spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller; or  has spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the tumor (the lymph node is larger than 3 centimeters but not larger than 6 centimeters) or to more than one lymph node anywhere in the neck (the lymph nodes are 6 centimeters or smaller), and one of the following is true:  tumor in the oropharynx is any size and may have spread to the epiglottis (the flap that covers the trachea during swallowing); or  tumor has spread to the larynx, front part of the roof of the mouth, lower jaw, or muscles that move the tongue or are used for chewing.  In stage. IVB, the tumor:  surrounds the carotid artery or has spread to the muscle that opens the jaw, the bone attached to the muscles that move the jaw, nasopharynx, or base of the skull. Cancer may have spread to one or more lymph nodes which can be any size; or  may be any size and has spread to one or more lymph nodes that are larger than 6 centimeters.  In stage. IVC, the tumor may be any size and has spread beyond the oropharynx to other parts of the body, such as the lung, bone, or liver.

Question: What are the stages of Oropharyngeal Cancer ?
Answer:  The following stages are used for oropharyngeal cancer: Stage 0: Carcinoma in situ. Stage. I: Cancer is 2 centimeters or smaller and has not spread to lymph nodes. Stage. II: Cancer is larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 4 centimeters and has not spread to lymph nodes. Stage. III: Cancer is larger than 4 centimeters or has spread to a single lymph node on the same side of the neck as the primary tumor. Stage. IVA: Cancer can be any size and has spread to multiple lymph nodes on the same side of the neck or is larger than 6 centimeters. Stage. IVB: Cancer has spread to surrounding tissues, such as the muscles in the floor of the mouth or the skin of the neck. Stage. IVC: Cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, such as the lungs or bones

Question: What is the outlook for Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma ?
Answer: Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:  How the melanoma cells look under a microscope.  The size and thickness of the tumor.  The part of the eye the tumor is in (the iris, ciliary body, or choroid).  Whether the tumor has spread within the eye or to other places in the body.  Whether there are certain changes in the genes linked to intraocular melanoma.  The patient's age and general health.  Whether the tumor has recurred (come back) after treatment.

Question: What is the outlook for Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma ?
Answer: The outlook for. Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma depends on several factors, including: The size of the tumor. The location of the tumor within the eye. Whether the cancer has spread beyond the eye. The overall health of the individual. The effectiveness of treatment options availableOverall, the prognosis for. Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma varies from person to person, and it is important to work closely with healthcare providers to determine the best course of action.

Question: What are the treatments for Vulvar Cancer ?
Answer: Key. Points. There are different types of treatment for patients with vulvar cancer.  Four types of standard treatment are used:  Surgery  Radiation therapy  Chemotherapy  Biologic therapy  New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.  Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.  Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.  Followup tests may be needed.There are different types of treatment for patients with vulvar cancer.Different types of treatments are available for patients with vulvar cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.Four types of standard treatment are used:Surgery. Surgery is the most common treatment for vulvar cancer. The goal of surgery is to remove all the cancer without any loss of the woman's sexual function. One of the following types of surgery may be done:  Laser surgery: A surgical procedure that uses a laser beam (a narrow beam of intense light) as a knife to make bloodless cuts in tissue or to remove a surface lesion such as a tumor.  Wide local excision: A surgical procedure to remove the cancer and some of the normal tissue around the cancer.  Radical local excision: A surgical procedure to remove the cancer and a large amount of normal tissue around it. Nearby lymph nodes in the groin may also be removed.  Ultrasound surgical aspiration (USA): A surgical procedure to break the tumor up into small pieces using very fine vibrations. The small pieces of tumor are washed away and removed by suction. This procedure causes less damage to nearby tissue.  Vulvectomy: A surgical procedure to remove part or all of the vulva:  Skinning vulvectomy: The top layer of vulvar skin where the cancer is found is removed. Skin grafts from other parts of the body may be needed to cover the area where the skin was removed.  Modified radical vulvectomy: Surgery to remove part of the vulva. Nearby lymph nodes may also be removed.  Radical vulvectomy: Surgery to remove the entire vulva. Nearby lymph nodes are also removed.  Pelvic exenteration: A surgical procedure to remove the lower colon, rectum, and bladder. The cervix, vagina, ovaries, and nearby lymph nodes are also removed. Artificial openings (stoma) are made for urine and stool to flow from the body into a collection bag. Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may have chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat vulvar cancer, and external radiation therapy may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, a body cavity such as the abdomen, or onto the skin, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. Topical chemotherapy for vulvar cancer may be applied to the skin in a cream or lotion. See. Drugs. Approved to. Treat. Vulvar. Cancer for more information. Biologic therapy. Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy. Imiquimod is a biologic therapy that may be used to treat vulvar lesions and is applied to the skin in a cream.New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.Information about clinical trials is available from the. NCI website.Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.

Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the. Treatment. Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from. NCI's listing of clinical trials.Followup tests may be needed.Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups. It is important to have regular followup exams to check for recurrent vulvar cancer.Treatment. Options by. StageVulvar. Intraepithelial.

Question: What are the treatments for Vulvar Cancer ?
Answer:  Surgery is the main treatment for vulvar cancer and may involve: Wide local excision: Removing the tumor and a margin of healthy tissue. Radical vulvectomy: Removing the entire vulva, including the clitoris and lymph nodes in the groin. Radiation therapy may be used after surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells. Chemotherapy is sometimes used in combination with surgery and/or radiation therapy to treat vulvar cancer. Targeted therapy and immunotherapy are being researched as potential treatments for vulvar cancer.

Question: What is (are) Breast Cancer ?
Answer: Key. Points. Breast cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the breast.  Sometimes breast cancer occurs in women who are pregnant or have just given birth.  Signs of breast cancer include a lump or change in the breast.  It may be difficult to detect (find) breast cancer early in pregnant or nursing women.  Breast exams should be part of prenatal and postnatal care.  Tests that examine the breasts are used to detect (find) and diagnose breast cancer.  If cancer is found, tests are done to study the cancer cells.  Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.Breast cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the breast.The breast is made up of lobes and ducts. Each breast has 15 to 20 sections called lobes. Each lobe has many smaller sections called lobules. Lobules end in dozens of tiny bulbs that can make milk. The lobes, lobules, and bulbs are linked by thin tubes called ducts. Each breast also has blood vessels and lymph vessels. The lymph vessels carry an almost colorless fluid called lymph. Lymph vessels carry lymph between lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are small beanshaped structures that are found throughout the body. They filter substances in lymph and help fight infection and disease. Clusters of lymph nodes are found near the breast in the axilla (under the arm), above the collarbone, and in the chest.It may be difficult to detect (find) breast cancer early in pregnant or nursing women.The breasts usually get larger, tender, or lumpy in women who are pregnant, nursing, or have just given birth. This occurs because of normal hormone changes that take place during pregnancy. These changes can make small lumps difficult to detect. The breasts may also become denser. It is more difficult to detect breast cancer in women with dense breasts using mammography. Because these breast changes can delay diagnosis, breast cancer is often found at a later stage in these women.Other. Information. About. Pregnancy and. Breast. CancerKey. Points. Lactation (breast milk production) and breastfeeding should be stopped if surgery or chemotherapy is planned.  Breast cancer does not appear to harm the unborn baby.  Pregnancy does not seem to affect the survival of women who have had breast cancer in the past.Lactation (breast milk production) and breastfeeding should be stopped if surgery or chemotherapy is planned.If surgery is planned, breastfeeding should be stopped to reduce blood flow in the breasts and make them smaller. Breastfeeding should also be stopped if chemotherapy is planned. Many anticancer drugs, especially cyclophosphamide and methotrexate, may occur in high levels in breast milk and may harm the nursing baby. Women receiving chemotherapy should not breastfeed. Stopping lactation does not improve the mother's prognosis.Breast cancer does not appear to harm the unborn baby.Breast cancer cells do not seem to pass from the mother to the unborn baby.Pregnancy does not seem to affect the survival of women who have had breast cancer in the past.For women who have had breast cancer, pregnancy does not seem to affect their survival. However, some doctors recommend that a woman wait 2 years after treatment for breast cancer before trying to have a baby, so that any early return of the cancer would be detected. This may affect a womans decision to become pregnant. The unborn baby does not seem to be affected if the mother has had breast cancer.

Question: What is (are) Breast Cancer ?
Answer: Answer: Breast cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the cells of the breast.  It can occur in both men and women, but it is much more common in women. Breast cancer can spread to other parts of the body if not treated early. Early detection through screenings like mammograms can help with successful treatment.

Question: How to diagnose Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors ?
Answer: Tests that examine the ovaries are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage ovarian low malignant potential tumor. The following tests and procedures may be used:  Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.  Pelvic exam : An exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum. A speculum is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease. A. Pap test of the cervix is usually done. The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas.  Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which highenergy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.Other patients may have a transvaginal ultrasound.  CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.  CA 125 assay : A test that measures the level of. CA 125 in the blood. CA 125 is a substance released by cells into the bloodstream. An increased. CA 125 level is sometimes a sign of cancer or other condition.  Chest xray : An xray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An xray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.  Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The tissue is usually removed during surgery to remove the tumor.

Question: How to diagnose Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors ?
Answer:  Ovarian low malignant potential tumors are usually found incidentally during surgery for another condition or during routine pelvic exams. To diagnose ovarian low malignant potential tumors, the following tests may be performed: Ultrasound: A procedure that uses sound waves to create images of the ovaries. Blood tests: To check for tumor markers like. CA125. Biopsy: A sample of tissue is taken from the ovary and examined under a microscope. Imaging tests such as. MRI or. CT scans may also be used to determine the extent of the tumor.

Question: What is (are) Prostate Cancer ?
Answer: Key. Points. Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the prostate.  Signs of prostate cancer include a weak flow of urine or frequent urination.  Tests that examine the prostate and blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose prostate cancer.  Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the prostate.The prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system. It lies just below the bladder (the organ that collects and empties urine) and in front of the rectum (the lower part of the intestine). It is about the size of a walnut and surrounds part of the urethra (the tube that empties urine from the bladder). The prostate gland makes fluid that is part of the semen. Prostate cancer is most common in older men. In the. U.S., about 1 out of 5 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer.

Question: What is (are) Prostate Cancer ?
Answer:  Prostate cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the prostate gland. The prostate gland is a small, walnutshaped gland in men that produces seminal fluid. Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in men. Risk factors for prostate cancer include age, family history, and race. Symptoms of prostate cancer may include frequent urination, trouble urinating, blood in the urine, and pain in the pelvis.

Question: Who is at risk for Adult Central Nervous System Tumors? ?
Answer: Having certain genetic syndromes may increase the risk of a central nervous system tumor. Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. There are few known risk factors for brain tumors. The following conditions may increase the risk of certain types of brain tumors:  Being exposed to vinyl chloride may increase the risk of glioma.  Infection with the. EpsteinBarr virus, having. AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), or receiving an organ transplant may increase the risk of primary. CNS lymphoma. (See the. PDQ summary on. Primary. CNS. Lymphoma for more information.)  Having certain genetic syndromes may increase the risk brain tumors:  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or 2 (NF2).  von. HippelLindau disease.  Tuberous sclerosis.  LiFraumeni syndrome.  Turcot syndrome type 1 or 2.  Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.

Question: Who is at risk for Adult Central Nervous System Tumors? ?
Answer:  People with certain genetic disorders, such as neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, LiFraumeni syndrome, or. Turcot syndrome. People who have been exposed to highdose radiation to the head as children. People who have certain genetic mutations, such as. PTCH1, TP53, RB1, or. NF2 gene mutations. People with a history of certain types of cancer, such as retinoblastoma, leukemia, or pituitary adenoma.

Question: What are the stages of Uterine Sarcoma ?
Answer: Key. Points. After uterine sarcoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body.  Uterine sarcoma may be diagnosed, staged, and treated in the same surgery.  There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.  Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.  The following stages are used for uterine sarcoma:  Stage. I  Stage. II  Stage. III  Stage. IVAfter uterine sarcoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body.The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The following procedures may be used in the staging process:  Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.  CA 125 assay : A test that measures the level of. CA 125 in the blood. CA 125 is a substance released by cells into the bloodstream. An increased. CA 125 level is sometimes a sign of cancer or other condition.  Chest xray : An xray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An xray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.  Transvaginal ultrasound exam: A procedure used to examine the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, and bladder. An ultrasound transducer (probe) is inserted into the vagina and used to bounce highenergy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The doctor can identify tumors by looking at the sonogram.  CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen and pelvis, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues to show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.  Cystoscopy : A procedure to look inside the bladder and urethra to check for abnormal areas. A cystoscope is inserted through the urethra into the bladder. A cystoscope is a thin, tubelike instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.Uterine sarcoma may be diagnosed, staged, and treated in the same surgery.Surgery is used to diagnose, stage, and treat uterine sarcoma. During this surgery, the doctor removes as much of the cancer as possible. The following procedures may be used to diagnose, stage, and treat uterine sarcoma:  Laparotomy: A surgical procedure in which an incision (cut) is made in the wall of the abdomen to check the inside of the abdomen for signs of disease. The size of the incision depends on the reason the laparotomy is being done. Sometimes organs are removed or tissue samples are taken and checked under a microscope for signs of disease.  Abdominal and pelvic washings: A procedure in which a saline solution is placed into the abdominal and pelvic body cavities. After a short time, the fluid is removed and viewed under a microscope to check for cancer cells.  Total abdominal hysterectomy: A surgical procedure to remove the uterus and cervix through a large incision (cut) in the abdomen.  Bilateral salpingooophorectomy: Surgery to remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes.  Lymphadenectomy: A surgical procedure in which lymph nodes are removed and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. For a regional lymphadenectomy, some of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed. For a radical lymphadenectomy, most or all of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed. This procedure is also called lymph node dissection. Treatment in addition to surgery may be given, as described in the. Treatment. Option. Overview section of this summary.There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:  Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.  Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.  Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.  Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.  Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if uterine sarcoma spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually uterine sarcoma cells. The disease is metastatic uterine sarcoma, not lung cancer.The following stages are used for uterine sarcoma:Stage. I. In stage. I, cancer is found in the uterus only. Stage. I is divided into stages. IA and. IB, based on how far the cancer has spread.  Stage. IA: Cancer is in the endometrium only or less than halfway through the myometrium (muscle layer of the uterus).  Stage. IB: Cancer has spread halfway or more into the myometrium. Stage. II. In stage. II, cancer has spread into connective tissue of the cervix, but has not spread outside the uterus. Stage. III. In stage. III, cancer has spread beyond the uterus and cervix, but has not spread beyond the pelvis. Stage. III is divided into stages. IIIA, IIIB, and. IIIC, based on how far the cancer has spread within the pelvis.  Stage. IIIA: Cancer has spread to the outer layer of the uterus and/or to the fallopian tubes, ovaries, and ligaments of the uterus.  Stage. IIIB: Cancer has spread to the vagina or to the parametrium (connective tissue and fat around the uterus).  Stage. IIIC: Cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the pelvis and/or around the aorta (largest artery in the body, which carries blood away from the heart). Stage. IV. In stage. IV, cancer has spread beyond the pelvis. Stage. IV is divided into stages. IVA and. IVB, based on how far the cancer has spread.  Stage. IVA: Cancer has spread to the bladder and/or bowel wall.  Stage. IVB: Cancer has spread to other parts of the body beyond the pelvis, including the abdomen and/or lymph nodes in the groin.

Question: What are the stages of Uterine Sarcoma ?
Answer: The stages of. Uterine. Sarcoma include: Stage 0: Abnormal cells are found in the lining of the uterus. Stage. I: Cancer is found in the uterus only. Stage. II: Cancer has spread from the uterus to the cervix. Stage. III: Cancer has spread beyond the uterus, cervix, and into nearby tissues. Stage. IV: Cancer has spread to the bladder, bowel, or other organs. 

Question: What is the outlook for Parathyroid Cancer ?
Answer: Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.

Whether the tumor and the capsule around the tumor can be completely removed by surgery.  The patient's general health.

Question: What is the outlook for Parathyroid Cancer ?
Answer:  Parathyroid cancer is a rare type of cancer that forms in the tissues of the parathyroid glands. The outlook for parathyroid cancer depends on various factors, such as the stage of the cancer at diagnosis and how well the cancer responds to treatment. Treatment options for parathyroid cancer may include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Early detection and prompt treatment are important factors in improving the outlook for individuals with parathyroid cancer.

Question: What is the outlook for Urethral Cancer ?
Answer: Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:  Where the cancer formed in the urethra.  Whether the cancer has spread through the mucosa lining the urethra to nearby tissue, to lymph nodes, or to other parts of the body.  Whether the patient is a male or female.  The patient's general health.  Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).

Question: What is the outlook for Urethral Cancer ?
Answer:  The outlook for urethral cancer depends on various factors including the stage of the cancer, the type of urethral cancer, the patient's overall health, and whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Treatment options for urethral cancer may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. The prognosis for urethral cancer can vary, but early detection and treatment can improve the chances of successful treatment and longterm survival.

Question: What are the stages of Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors ?

Question: What is (are) Gallbladder Cancer ?
Answer: Key. Points. Gallbladder cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the gallbladder.  Being female can increase the risk of developing gallbladder cancer.  Signs and symptoms of gallbladder cancer include jaundice, fever, and pain.  Gallbladder cancer is difficult to detect (find) and diagnose early.  Tests that examine the gallbladder and nearby organs are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage gallbladder cancer.  Certain factors affect the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.Gallbladder cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the gallbladder.Gallbladder cancer is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells are found in the tissues of the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a pearshaped organ that lies just under the liver in the upper abdomen. The gallbladder stores bile, a fluid made by the liver to digest fat. When food is being broken down in the stomach and intestines, bile is released from the gallbladder through a tube called the common bile duct, which connects the gallbladder and liver to the first part of the small intestine. The wall of the gallbladder has 3 main layers of tissue.  Mucosal (inner) layer.  Muscularis (middle, muscle) layer.  Serosal (outer) layer. Between these layers is supporting connective tissue. Primary gallbladder cancer starts in the inner layer and spreads through the outer layers as it grows.Gallbladder cancer is difficult to detect (find) and diagnose early.Gallbladder cancer is difficult to detect and diagnose for the following reasons:  There are no signs or symptoms in the early stages of gallbladder cancer.  The symptoms of gallbladder cancer, when present, are like the symptoms of many other illnesses.  The gallbladder is hidden behind the liver. Gallbladder cancer is sometimes found when the gallbladder is removed for other reasons. Patients with gallstones rarely develop gallbladder cancer.

Question: What is (are) Gallbladder Cancer ?
Answer:  Gallbladder cancer is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the gallbladder. Being female, having a history of gallstones, or having certain genetic conditions may increase the risk of gallbladder cancer. Signs of gallbladder cancer include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes), abdominal pain, and unexplained weight loss. Tests that examine the gallbladder and nearby organs are used to detect and diagnose gallbladder cancer. Factors such as the stage of the cancer and overall health of the patient affect treatment options and prognosis.

Question: what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Childhood Central Nervous System Germ Cell Tumors ?
Answer: Check the list of. NCIsupported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with childhood central nervous system germ cell tumor. For more specific results, refine the search by using other search features, such as the location of the trial, the type of treatment, or the name of the drug. Talk with your child's doctor about clinical trials that may be right for your child. General information about clinical trials is available from the. NCI website.New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.Information about clinical trials is available from the. NCI website.Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the. Current. Clinical. Trials section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from the. NCI's listing of clinical trials.

Question: what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Childhood Central Nervous System Germ Cell Tumors ?
Answer:  Clinical trials are being conducted to study new treatments for childhood central nervous system germ cell tumors. These trials may involve new chemotherapy drugs, targeted therapies, radiation techniques, or combinations of treatments. Researchers are also looking into the genetic and molecular factors that contribute to the development of these tumors to develop personalized treatment approaches.

Question: How to diagnose Small Intestine Cancer ?
Answer: Tests that examine the small intestine are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage small intestine cancer.Procedures that make pictures of the small intestine and the area around it help diagnose small intestine cancer and show how far the cancer has spread. The process used to find out if cancer cells have spread within and around the small intestine is called staging. In order to plan treatment, it is important to know the type of small intestine cancer and whether the tumor can be removed by surgery. Tests and procedures to detect, diagnose, and stage small intestine cancer are usually done at the same time. The following tests and procedures may be used:  Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.  Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.  Liver function tests : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver. A higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign of liver disease that may be caused by small intestine cancer.  Endoscopy : A procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for abnormal areas. There are different types of endoscopy:  Upper endoscopy : A procedure to look at the inside of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum (first part of the small intestine, near the stomach). An endoscope is inserted through the mouth and into the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. An endoscope is a thin, tubelike instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.  Capsule endoscopy : A procedure to look at the inside of the small intestine. A capsule that is about the size of a large pill and contains a light and a tiny wireless camera is swallowed by the patient. The capsule travels through the digestive tract, including the small intestine, and sends many pictures of the inside of the digestive tract to a recorder that is worn around the waist or over the shoulder. The pictures are sent from the recorder to a computer and viewed by the doctor who checks for signs of cancer. The capsule passes out of the body during a bowel movement.  Double balloon endoscopy : A procedure to look at the inside of the small intestine. A special instrument made up of two tubes (one inside the other) is inserted through the mouth or rectum and into the small intestine. The inside tube (an endoscope with a light and lens for viewing) is moved through part of the small intestine and a balloon at the end of it is inflated to keep the endoscope in place. Next, the outer tube is moved through the small intestine to reach the end of the endoscope, and a balloon at the end of the outer tube is inflated to keep it in place. Then, the balloon at the end of the endoscope is deflated and the endoscope is moved through the next part of the small intestine. These steps are repeated many times as the tubes move through the small intestine. The doctor is able to see the inside of the small intestine through the endoscope and use a tool to remove samples of abnormal tissue. The tissue samples are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure may be done if the results of a capsule endoscopy are abnormal. This procedure is also called double balloon enteroscopy.  Laparotomy : A surgical procedure in which an incision (cut) is made in the wall of the abdomen to check the inside of the abdomen for signs of disease. The size of the incision depends on the reason the laparotomy is being done. Sometimes organs or lymph nodes are removed or tissue samples are taken and checked under a microscope for signs of disease.  Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer. This may be done during an endoscopy or laparotomy. The sample is checked by a pathologist to see if it contains cancer cells.  Upper. GI series with small bowel followthrough: A series of xrays of the esophagus, stomach, and small bowel. The patient drinks a liquid that contains barium (a silverwhite metallic compound). The liquid coats the esophagus, stomach, and small bowel. Xrays are taken at different times as the barium travels through the upper. GI tract and small bowel.  CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.  MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).

Question: How to diagnose Small Intestine Cancer ?
Answer: Key. Points. Tests used to diagnose small intestine cancer may include physical exam and history, blood chemistry studies, fecal occult blood test, imaging tests, biopsy, and other tests.Tests used to diagnose small intestine cancer may include: Physical exam and history: The doctor checks for signs of disease. The medical history of the patient is also taken into account. Blood chemistry studies: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. Fecal occult blood test: A test to check stool (solid waste) for blood that can only be seen with a microscope. Imaging tests: Procedures that create pictures of areas inside the body to determine if there is cancer present. Biopsy: The removal of cells or tissues for examination under a microscope. Other tests: Additional tests may be done depending on the results of the initial tests.

Question: What are the stages of AIDS-Related Lymphoma ?
Answer: Key. Points. After. AIDSrelated lymphoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body.  There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.  Stages of. AIDSrelated lymphoma may include. E and. S.  The following stages are used for. AIDSrelated lymphoma:  Stage. I  Stage. II  Stage. III  Stage. IV  For treatment, AIDSrelated lymphomas are grouped based on where they started in the body, as follows:  Peripheral/systemic lymphoma  Primary. CNS lymphomaAfter. AIDSrelated lymphoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body.The process used to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment, but. AIDSrelated lymphoma is usually advanced when it is diagnosed. The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:  Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. The blood sample will be checked for the level of. LDH (lactate dehydrogenase).  CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the lung, lymph nodes, and liver, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.  PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The. PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.  MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium : A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. A substance called gadolinium is injected into the patient through a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).  Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal column. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the. CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid. The sample of. CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord. The sample may also be checked for. EpsteinBarr virus. This procedure is also called an. LP or spinal tap.There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:  Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.  Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.  Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.Stages of. AIDSrelated lymphoma may include. E and. S.AIDSrelated lymphoma may be described as follows:  E: "E" stands for extranodal and means the cancer is found in an area or organ other than the lymph nodes or has spread to tissues beyond, but near, the major lymphatic areas.  S: "S" stands for spleen and means the cancer is found in the spleen.The following stages are used for. AIDSrelated lymphoma:Stage. I. Stage. I. AIDSrelated lymphoma is divided into stage. I and stage. IE.  Stage. I: Cancer is found in one lymphatic area (lymph node group, tonsils and nearby tissue, thymus, or spleen).  Stage. IE: Cancer is found in one organ or area outside the lymph nodes. Stage. II. Stage. II. AIDSrelated lymphoma is divided into stage. II and stage. IIE.  Stage. II: Cancer is found in two or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm (the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen).  Stage. IIE: Cancer is found in one or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm. Cancer is also found outside the lymph nodes in one organ or area on the same side of the diaphragm as the affected lymph nodes. Stage. III. Stage. III. AIDSrelated lymphoma is divided into stage. III, stage. IIIE, stage. IIIS, and stage. IIIE+S.  Stage. III: Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm (the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen).  Stage. IIIE: Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm and outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area.  Stage. IIIS: Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm, and in the spleen.  Stage. IIIE+S: Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm, outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area, and in the spleen. Stage. IV. In stage. IV. AIDSrelated lymphoma, the cancer:  is found throughout one or more organs that are not part of a lymphatic area (lymph node group, tonsils and nearby tissue, thymus, or spleen) and may be in lymph nodes near those organs; or  is found in one organ that is not part of a lymphatic area and has spread to organs or lymph nodes far away from that organ; or  is found in the liver, bone marrow, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or lungs (other than cancer that has spread to the lungs from nearby areas). Patients who are infected with the. EpsteinBarr virus or whose. AIDSrelated lymphoma affects the bone marrow have an increased risk of the cancer spreading to the central nervous system (CNS).For treatment, AIDSrelated lymphomas are grouped based on where they started in the body, as follows:Peripheral/systemic lymphoma. Lymphoma that starts in the lymph system or elsewhere in the body, other than the brain, is called peripheral/systemic lymphoma. It may spread throughout the body, including to the brain or bone marrow. It is often diagnosed in an advanced stage. Primary. CNS lymphoma. Primary. CNS lymphoma starts in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). It is linked to the. EpsteinBarr virus. Lymphoma that starts somewhere else in the body and spreads to the central nervous system is not primary. CNS lymphoma.

Question: What are the stages of AIDS-Related Lymphoma ?
Answer: Key. Points. Tests done to detect. AIDSrelated lymphoma are also used to stage the disease. There are four stages of. AIDSrelated lymphoma. The following stages are used for. AIDSrelated lymphoma: Stage. I. Stage. II. Stage. III. Stage. IV. The stage of. AIDSrelated lymphoma determines the treatment approach and prognosis.

Question: What is (are) Breast Cancer ?
Answer: Key. Points. Breast cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the breast.  Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death from cancer in. American women.  Different factors increase or decrease the risk of breast cancer.Breast cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the breast.The breast is made up of lobes and ducts. Each breast has 15 to 20 sections called lobes, which have many smaller sections called lobules. Lobules end in dozens of tiny bulbs that can produce milk. The lobes, lobules, and bulbs are linked by thin tubes called ducts. Each breast also contains blood vessels and lymph vessels. The lymph vessels carry an almost colorless fluid called lymph. Lymph vessels lead to organs called lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are small beanshaped structures that are found throughout the body. They filter substances in lymph and help fight infection and disease. Clusters of lymph nodes are found near the breast in the axilla (under the arm), above the collarbone, and in the chest. See the following. PDQ summaries for more information about breast cancer:  Breast. Cancer. Prevention  Breast. Cancer. Treatment  Genetics of. Breast and. Gynecologic. CancersBreast cancer is the second leading cause of death from cancer in. American women.Women in the. United. States get breast cancer more than any other type of cancer except for skin cancer. Breast cancer is second only to lung cancer as a cause of cancer death in women. Breast cancer occurs more often in white women than in black women. However, black women are more likely than white women to die from the disease. Breast cancer occurs in men also, but the number of cases is small.

Question: What is (are) Breast Cancer ?
Answer:  Breast cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the breast. There are different types of breast cancer, including ductal carcinoma in situ, invasive ductal carcinoma, and lobular carcinoma. Risk factors for breast cancer include age, family history, genetics, hormonal factors, and lifestyle factors. Symptoms of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, changes in the size or shape of the breast, nipple discharge, or skin changes. Tests used to detect and diagnose breast cancer include mammograms, biopsies, and imaging tests. Treatment options for breast cancer may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or targeted therapy. The prognosis for breast cancer depends on various factors, including the stage of the cancer, the type of cancer, and the individual's overall health.

Question: What is (are) Skin Cancer ?
Answer: Key. Points. Skin cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the skin.  There are several types of skin cancer.  Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the. United. States.Skin cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the skin.The skin is the bodys largest organ. It protects against heat, sunlight, injury, and infection. Skin also helps control body temperature and stores water, fat, and vitamin. D. The skin has several layers, but the two main layers are the epidermis (upper or outer layer) and the dermis (lower or inner layer). The epidermis is made up of 3 kinds of cells:  Squamous cells are the thin, flat cells that make up most of the epidermis.  Basal cells are the round cells under the squamous cells.  Melanocytes are found throughout the lower part of the epidermis. They make melanin, the pigment that gives skin its natural color. When skin is exposed to the sun, melanocytes make more pigment, causing the skin to tan, or darken. The dermis contains blood and lymph vessels, hair follicles, and glands. See the following. PDQ summaries for more information about skin cancer:  Skin. Cancer. Screening  Skin. Cancer. Treatment  Melanoma. Treatment  Genetics of. Skin. CancerThere are several types of skin cancer.The most common types of skin cancer are squamous cell carcinoma, which forms in the squamous cells and basal cell carcinoma, which forms in the basal cells. Squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma are also called nonmelanoma skin cancers. Melanoma, which forms in the melanocytes, is a less common type of skin cancer that grows and spreads quickly. Skin cancer can occur anywhere on the body, but it is most common in areas exposed to sunlight, such as the face, neck, hands, and arms.Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the. United. States.Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are the most common types of skin cancer in the. United. States. The number of new cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer appears to be increasing every year. These nonmelanoma skin cancers can usually be cured. The number of new cases of melanoma has been increasing for at least 30 years. Melanoma is more likely to spread to nearby tissues and other parts of the body and can be harder to cure. Finding and treating melanoma skin cancer early may help prevent death from melanoma.

Question: What are the treatments for Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors ?
Answer: Key. Points. There are different types of treatment for patients with ovarian germ cell tumors.  Four types of standard treatment are used:  Surgery  Observation  Chemotherapy  Radiation therapy  New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.  Highdose chemotherapy with bone marrow transplant  New treatment options  Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.  Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.  Followup tests may be needed.There are different types of treatment for patients with ovarian germ cell tumors.Different types of treatment are available for patients with ovarian germ cell tumor. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.Four types of standard treatment are used:Surgery. Surgery is the most common treatment of ovarian germ cell tumor. A doctor may take out the cancer using one of the following types of surgery.  Unilateral salpingooophorectomy: A surgical procedure to remove one ovary and one fallopian tube.  Total hysterectomy: A surgical procedure to remove the uterus, including the cervix. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through the vagina, the operation is called a vaginal hysterectomy. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large incision (cut) in the abdomen, the operation is called a total abdominal hysterectomy. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision (cut) in the abdomen using a laparoscope, the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy.  Bilateral salpingooophorectomy: A surgical procedure to remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes.  Tumor debulking: A surgical procedure in which as much of the tumor as possible is removed. Some tumors cannot be completely removed. Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation, some patients may be offered chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. After chemotherapy for an ovarian germ cell tumor, a secondlook laparotomy may be done. This is similar to the laparotomy that is done to find out the stage of the cancer. Secondlook laparotomy is a surgical procedure to find out if tumor cells are left after primary treatment. During this procedure, the doctor will take samples of lymph nodes and other tissues in the abdomen to see if any cancer is left. This procedure is not done for dysgerminomas. Observation. Observation is closely watching a patients condition without giving any treatment unless signs or symptoms appear or change. Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. See. Drugs. Approved for. Ovarian, Fallopian. Tube, or. Primary. Peritoneal. Cancer for more information. Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat ovarian germ cell tumors.New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the. NCI website. Highdose chemotherapy with bone marrow transplant. Highdose chemotherapy with bone marrow transplant is a method of giving very high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the bodys blood cells. New treatment options. Combination chemotherapy (the use of more than one anticancer drug) is being tested in clinical trials.Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the. Treatment. Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from. NCI's listing of clinical trials.Followup tests may be needed.Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups.Treatment. Options. By. StageStage. I. Ovarian. Germ. Cell.

Answer: The treatments for. Ovarian. Germ. Cell. Tumors include: Surgery: The main treatment for ovarian germ cell tumors is surgery to remove the tumor and any affected surrounding tissues. Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy may be recommended before or after surgery to kill cancer cells that remain in the body. Radiation therapy: In some cases, radiation therapy may be used to target and destroy cancer cells in the affected area. Fertilitysparing options: For young women who wish to preserve their fertility, conservative surgical options may be considered to remove the tumor while preserving the ovaries. Followup care: Regular monitoring and followup appointments will be scheduled to check for any signs of recurrence or complications.

Question: What is the outlook for Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma ?
Answer: Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:  The patient's age.  Where in the body the tumor started.  The size of the tumor at the time of diagnosis.  Whether the tumor has been completely removed by surgery.  The type of rhabdomyosarcoma (embryonal, alveolar, or anaplastic).  Whether there are certain changes in the genes.  Whether the tumor had spread to other parts of the body at the time of diagnosis.  Whether the tumor was in the lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis.  Whether the tumor responds to chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. For patients with recurrent cancer, prognosis and treatment also depend on the following:  Where in the body the tumor recurred (came back).  How much time passed between the end of cancer treatment and when the cancer recurred.  Whether the tumor was treated with radiation therapy.

Question: What is the outlook for Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma ?
Answer:  The outlook for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma depends on various factors such as the stage of the cancer, the location of the tumor, and whether it has spread to other parts of the body. Treatment options for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The overall survival rate for children with rhabdomyosarcoma has improved over the years due to advancements in treatment and early detection.

Question: Who is at risk for Endometrial Cancer? ?
Answer: Health history and certain medicines can affect the risk of developing endometrial cancer. Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. People who think they may be at risk should discuss this with their doctor. Risk factors for endometrial cancer include the following:  Taking tamoxifen for treatment or prevention of breast cancer.  Taking estrogen alone. (Taking estrogen in combination with progestin does not appear to increase the risk of endometrial cancer.)  Being overweight.  Eating a highfat diet.  Never giving birth.  Beginning menstruation at an early age.  Reaching menopause at an older age.  Having the gene for hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC).  Being white.

Question: Who is at risk for Endometrial Cancer? ?
Answer:  Women over the age of 50 Women who have never had children. Women with an early onset of menstruation. Women with a history of irregular periods or infertility. Women who have never used oral contraceptives

Question: What is the outlook for Childhood Extracranial Germ Cell Tumors ?
Answer: Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:  The type of germ cell tumor.

Answer: Key. Points. Retinoblastoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the retina.  Retinoblastoma occurs in heritable and nonheritable forms.  Treatment for both forms of retinoblastoma should include genetic counseling.  Children with a family history of retinoblastoma should have eye exams to check for retinoblastoma.  A child who has heritable retinoblastoma has an increased risk of trilateral retinoblastoma and other cancers.  Signs and symptoms of retinoblastoma include "white pupil" and eye pain or redness.  Tests that examine the retina are used to detect (find) and diagnose retinoblastoma.  Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.Retinoblastoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the retina.The retina is the nerve tissue that lines the inside of the back of the eye. The retina senses light and sends images to the brain by way of the optic nerve. Although retinoblastoma may occur at any age, it occurs most often in children younger than 2 years. The cancer may be in one eye (unilateral) or in both eyes (bilateral). Retinoblastoma rarely spreads from the eye to nearby tissue or other parts of the body. Cavitary retinoblastoma is a rare type of retinoblastoma in which cavities (hollow spaces) form within the tumor.Treatment for both forms of retinoblastoma should include genetic counseling.Parents should receive genetic counseling (a discussion with a trained professional about the risk of genetic diseases) to discuss genetic testing to check for a mutation (change) in the. RB1 gene. Genetic counseling also includes a discussion of the risk of retinoblastoma for the child and the child's brothers or sisters.

Question: What is (are) Retinoblastoma ?
Answer: ` Retinoblastoma is a rare type of eye cancer that begins in the retina, the part of the eye that detects light and color. Retinoblastoma is most commonly diagnosed in children under the age of 5. Signs and symptoms of retinoblastoma may include a white color in the center of the eye (leukocoria), crossed eyes, eye pain, redness or swelling of the eye, or poor vision. Treatment for retinoblastoma may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these treatments.`

Question: What is (are) Anal Cancer ?
Answer: Key. Points. Anal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the anus.  Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of anal cancer.  In the. United. States, the number of new cases of anal cancer has increased in recent years.Anal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the anus.The anus is the end of the large intestine, below the rectum, through which stool (solid waste) leaves the body. The anus is formed partly from the outer skin layers of the body and partly from the intestine. Two ringlike muscles, called sphincter muscles, open and close the anal opening and let stool pass out of the body. The anal canal, the part of the anus between the rectum and the anal opening, is about 11 inches long. The skin around the outside of the anus is called the perianal area. Tumors in this area are skin tumors, not anal cancer. See the following. PDQ summary for more information about anal cancer:  Anal. Cancer. TreatmentSquamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of anal cancer.In the. United. States, the most common type of anal cancer is squamous cell carcinoma. Studies show that human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the main cause of this type of anal cancer. Another type of anal cancer, called anal adenocarcinoma, is very rare and is not discussed in this summary.In the. United. States, the number of new cases of anal cancer has increased in recent years.From 2004 to 2013, new cases of anal cancer and deaths from anal cancer increased each year. The increase in new cases was slightly higher in women and the increase in deaths from anal cancer was slightly higher in men.

Question: What is (are) Anal Cancer ?
Answer:  Anal cancer is a type of cancer that forms in tissues of the anus.

Question: What is the outlook for Hypopharyngeal Cancer ?
Answer: Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. Prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on the following:  The stage of the cancer (whether it affects part of the hypopharynx, involves the whole hypopharynx, or has spread to other places in the body). Hypopharyngeal cancer is usually detected in later stages because early signs and symptoms rarely occur.  The patient's age, gender, and general health.  The location of the cancer.  Whether the patient smokes during radiation therapy. Treatment options depend on the following:  The stage of the cancer.  Keeping the patient's ability to talk, eat, and breathe as normal as possible.  The patient's general health. Patients who have had hypopharyngeal cancer are at an increased risk of developing a second cancer in the head or neck. Frequent and careful followup is important.

Question: What is the outlook for Hypopharyngeal Cancer ?
Answer:  The outlook for. Hypopharyngeal. Cancer depends on factors such as the stage of the cancer, the patient's overall health, and the specific characteristics of the tumor. Treatment options for. Hypopharyngeal. Cancer may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of these. Early detection and prompt treatment can improve prognosis and quality of life for patients with. Hypopharyngeal. Cancer.

Question: What are the treatments for Primary CNS Lymphoma ?
Answer: Key. Points. There are different types of treatment for patients with primary. CNS lymphoma.  Three standard treatments are used:  Radiation therapy  Chemotherapy  Steroid therapy  New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.  Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant  Targeted therapy  Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.  Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.  Followup tests may be needed.There are different types of treatment for patients with primary. CNS lymphoma.Different types of treatment are available for patients with primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Surgery is not used to treat primary. CNS lymphoma.Three standard treatments are used:Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Because primary. CNS lymphoma spreads throughout the brain, external radiation therapy is given to the whole brain. This is called whole brain radiation therapy.  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on whether the patient has primary. CNS lymphoma and. AIDS. External radiation therapy is used to treat primary. CNS lymphoma. Highdose radiation therapy to the brain can damage healthy tissue and cause disorders that can affect thinking, learning, problem solving, speech, reading, writing, and memory. Clinical trials have tested the use of chemotherapy alone or before radiation therapy to reduce the damage to healthy brain tissue that occurs with the use of radiation therapy. Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal chemotherapy), an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on where the tumor is in the. CNS or eye. Primary. CNS lymphoma may be treated with systemic chemotherapy, intrathecal chemotherapy and/or intraventricular chemotherapy, in which anticancer drugs are placed into the ventricles (fluid filled cavities) of the brain. If primary. CNS lymphoma is found in the eye, anticancer drugs are injected directly into the vitreous humor (jellylike substance) inside the eye. A network of blood vessels and tissue, called the bloodbrain barrier, protects the brain from harmful substances. This barrier can also keep anticancer drugs from reaching the brain. In order to treat. CNS lymphoma, certain drugs may be used to make openings between cells in the bloodbrain barrier. This is called bloodbrain barrier disruption. Anticancer drugs infused into the bloodstream may then reach the brain. Steroid therapy. Steroids are hormones made naturally in the body. They can also be made in a laboratory and used as drugs. Glucocorticoids are steroid drugs that have an anticancer effect in lymphomas.New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the. NCI website. Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant. Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells. Targeted therapy. Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. Monoclonal antibody therapy is one type of targeted therapy being studied in the treatment of primary. CNS lymphoma. Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. Rituximab is a type of monoclonal antibody used to treat newly diagnosed primary. CNS lymphoma in patients who do not have. AIDS.Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the. Treatment. Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from. NCI's listing of clinical trials.Followup tests may be needed.Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups.Treatment. Options for. Primary. CNS. LymphomaPrimary. CNS. Lymphoma. Not. Related to. AIDSTreatment of primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma in patients who do not have. AIDS may include the following:  Whole brain radiation therapy.  Chemotherapy.  Chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy.  Chemotherapy and targeted therapy (rituximab) followed by highdose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant.  A clinical trial of highdose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant.  A clinical trial of highdose chemotherapy and targeted therapy (rituximab), with or without stem cell transplant or whole brain radiation therapy.Primary. CNS. Lymphoma. Related to. AIDSTreatment of primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma in patients who do have. AIDS may include the following:  Whole brain radiation therapy.  Chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy. Treatment of primary. CNS lymphoma is different in patients with. AIDS because the treatment side effects may be more severe. (See the. PDQ summary on. AIDSRelated. Lymphoma. Treatment for more information).Primary. Intraocular. LymphomaTreatment of primary intraocular lymphoma may include the following:  Chemotherapy (intraocular or systemic).  Whole brain radiation therapy.Recurrent. Primary. CNS. LymphomaTreatment of recurrent primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma may include the following:  Chemotherapy.  Radiation therapy (if not received in earlier treatment).  A clinical trial of a new drug or treatment schedule.

Answer:  Chemotherapy. Radiation therapy. Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant. Corticosteroids. Targeted therapy. Clinical trials

Question: What are the stages of Laryngeal Cancer ?
Answer: Key. Points. After laryngeal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the larynx or to other parts of the body.  There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.  Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.  The following stages are used for laryngeal cancer:  Stage 0 (Carcinoma in. Situ)  Stage. I  Stage. II  Stage. III  Stage. IVAfter laryngeal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the larynx or to other parts of the body.The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the larynx or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage of the disease in order to plan treatment. The results of some of the tests used to diagnose laryngeal cancer are often also used to stage the disease.There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:  Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.  Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.  Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.  Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.  Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if laryngeal cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually laryngeal cancer cells. The disease is metastatic laryngeal cancer, not lung cancer.The following stages are used for laryngeal cancer:Stage 0 (Carcinoma in. Situ) In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the lining of the larynx. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ. Stage. I. In stage. I, cancer has formed. Stage. I laryngeal cancer depends on where cancer began in the larynx:  Supraglottis: Cancer is in one area of the supraglottis only and the vocal cords can move normally.  Glottis: Cancer is in one or both vocal cords and the vocal cords can move normally.  Subglottis: Cancer is in the subglottis only. Stage. II. In stage. II, cancer is in the larynx only. Stage. II laryngeal cancer depends on where cancer began in the larynx:  Supraglottis: Cancer is in more than one area of the supraglottis or surrounding tissues.  Glottis: Cancer has spread to the supraglottis and/or the subglottis and/or the vocal cords cannot move normally.  Subglottis: Cancer has spread to one or both vocal cords, which may not move normally. Stage. III. Stage. III laryngeal cancer depends on whether cancer has spread from the supraglottis, glottis, or subglottis. In stage. III cancer of the supraglottis:  cancer is in the larynx only and the vocal cords cannot move, and/or cancer is in tissues next to the larynx. Cancer may have spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller; or  cancer is in one area of the supraglottis and in one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor; the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller and the vocal cords can move normally; or  cancer is in more than one area of the supraglottis or surrounding tissues and in one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor; the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller. In stage. III cancer of the glottis:  cancer is in the larynx only and the vocal cords cannot move, and/or cancer is in tissues next to the larynx; cancer may have spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller; or  cancer is in one or both vocal cords and in one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor; the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller and the vocal cords can move normally; or  cancer has spread to the supraglottis and/or the subglottis and/or the vocal cords cannot move normally. Cancer has also spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller. In stage. III cancer of the subglottis:  cancer is in the larynx and the vocal cords cannot move; cancer may have spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller; or  cancer is in the subglottis and in one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor; the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller; or  cancer has spread to one or both vocal cords, which may not move normally. Cancer has also spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller. Stage. IV. Stage. IV is divided into stage. IVA, stage. IVB, and stage. IVC. Each substage is the same for cancer in the supraglottis, glottis, or subglottis.  In stage. IVA:  cancer has spread through the thyroid cartilage and/or has spread to tissues beyond the larynx such as the neck, trachea, thyroid, or esophagus. Cancer may have spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller; or  cancer has spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor and the lymph node is larger than 3 centimeters but not larger than 6 centimeters, or has spread to more than one lymph node anywhere in the neck with none larger than 6 centimeters. Cancer may have spread to tissues beyond the larynx, such as the neck, trachea, thyroid, or esophagus. The vocal cords may not move normally.  In stage. IVB:  cancer has spread to the space in front of the spinal column, surrounds the carotid artery, or has spread to parts of the chest. Cancer may have spread to one or more lymph nodes anywhere in the neck and the lymph nodes may be any size; or  cancer has spread to a lymph node that is larger than 6 centimeters and may have spread as far as the space in front of the spinal column, around the carotid artery, or to parts of the chest. The vocal cords may not move normally.  In stage. IVC, cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, liver, or bone.

Question: What are the stages of Laryngeal Cancer ?
Answer: The stages of. Laryngeal. Cancer are: Stage 0: Carcinoma in situ. Stage. I: Cancer is only in the larynx and is less than 2 cm in size. Stage. II: Cancer is larger than 2 cm but has not spread to nearby tissues or lymph nodes. Stage. III: Cancer has spread to nearby tissues in the larynx or nearby lymph nodes. Stage. IV: Cancer has spread to other parts of the body or nearby structures

Question: What are the symptoms of Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors ?
Answer: Signs of ovarian germ cell tumor are swelling of the abdomen or vaginal bleeding after menopause. Ovarian germ cell tumors can be hard to diagnose (find) early. Often there are no symptoms in the early stages, but tumors may be found during regular gynecologic exams (checkups). Check with your doctor if you have either of the following:  Swollen abdomen without weight gain in other parts of the body.  Bleeding from the vagina after menopause (when you are no longer having menstrual periods).

Question: What are the symptoms of Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors ?
Answer: Symptoms of. Ovarian. Germ. Cell. Tumors may include: Abdominal swelling or bloating. Pelvic pain or pressure. Frequent urination. Changes in bowel habits. Nausea or vomiting. Loss of appetite. Fatigue. Unexplained weight loss. Menstrual irregularities

Question: What are the symptoms of Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma ?
Answer: A sign of adult soft tissue sarcoma is a lump or swelling in soft tissue of the body. A sarcoma may appear as a painless lump under the skin, often on an arm or a leg. Sarcomas that begin in the abdomen may not cause signs or symptoms until they get very big. As the sarcoma grows bigger and presses on nearby organs, nerves, muscles, or blood vessels, signs and symptoms may include:  Pain.  Trouble breathing. Other conditions may cause the same signs and symptoms. Check with your doctor if you have any of these problems.

Question: What are the symptoms of Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma ?
Answer:  Symptoms of. Adult. Soft. Tissue. Sarcoma: A lump or swelling in soft tissue. Pain or tenderness in the affected area. Difficulty breathing or swallowing if the tumor is in the chest. Abdominal pain or a sense of fullness if the tumor is in the abdomen. Neurological symptoms if the tumor affects nerves. Fatigue or unexplained weight loss.

Question: What is the outlook for Nasopharyngeal Cancer ?
Answer: Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:  The stage of the cancer (whether it affects part of the nasopharynx, involves the whole nasopharynx, or has spread to other places in the body).  The type of nasopharyngeal cancer.  The size of the tumor.  The patients age and general health.

Question: What is the outlook for Nasopharyngeal Cancer ?
Answer: The outlook for. Nasopharyngeal. Cancer depends on various factors, including the stage of the cancer, the patient's overall health, and how well the cancer responds to treatment. Generally, the earlier the cancer is diagnosed and treated, the better the prognosis. Factors affecting the outlook for. Nasopharyngeal. Cancer may include: The stage of the cancer (extent of spread) The type of. Nasopharyngeal. Cancer. The patient's age and overall health. Response to treatment (surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy) Presence of any genetic mutations or biomarkers

Question: How to diagnose Primary CNS Lymphoma ?
Answer: Tests that examine the eyes, brain, and spinal cord are used to detect (find) and diagnose primary. CNS lymphoma. The following tests and procedures may be used:  Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.  Neurological exam : A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. The exam checks a persons mental status, coordination, ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.  Slitlamp eye exam : An exam that uses a special microscope with a bright, narrow slit of light to check the outside and inside of the eye.  MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain and spinal cord. A substance called gadolinium is injected into the patient through a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).  PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The. PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.  Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal column. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the. CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid. The sample of. CSF is checked under a microscope for signs of tumor cells. The sample may also be checked for the amounts of protein and glucose. A higher than normal amount of protein or lower than normal amount of glucose may be a sign of a tumor. This procedure is also called an. LP or spinal tap.  Stereotactic biopsy : A biopsy procedure that uses a computer and a 3dimensional (3D) scanning device to find a tumor site and guide the removal of tissue so it can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer. The following tests may be done on the samples of tissue that are removed:  Flow cytometry : A laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample, the percentage of live cells in a sample, and certain characteristics of cells, such as size, shape, and the presence of tumor markers on the cell surface. The cells are stained with a lightsensitive dye, placed in a fluid, and passed in a stream before a laser or other type of light. The measurements are based on how the lightsensitive dye reacts to the light.  Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer.  Cytogenetic analysis: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes. Other tests, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), may also be done to look for certain changes in the chromosomes.  Complete blood count (CBC) with differential : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:  The number of red blood cells and platelets.  The number and type of white blood cells.  The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.  The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.  Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.

Question: How to diagnose Primary CNS Lymphoma ?
Answer:  Primary. CNS. Lymphoma can be diagnosed through a combination of imaging tests such as. MRI or. CT scans to identify tumors in the brain or spinal cord. A biopsy is usually performed to confirm the diagnosis by examining a sample of the tumor tissue. Lumbar puncture may also be done to analyze cerebrospinal fluid for lymphoma cells. Blood tests can help evaluate overall health and detect any abnormalities related to the lymphoma.

Question: What causes Adult Central Nervous System Tumors ?
Answer: The cause of most adult brain and spinal cord tumors is not known.

Question: What causes Adult Central Nervous System Tumors ?
Answer:  The exact cause of adult central nervous system tumors is unknown. Risk factors that may increase the likelihood of developing these tumors include genetic disorders, exposure to ionizing radiation, and certain inherited conditions such as neurofibromatosis and. LiFraumeni syndrome.

Question: What are the treatments for Childhood Soft Tissue Sarcoma ?
Answer: Key. Points. There are different types of treatment for patients with childhood soft tissue sarcoma.  Children with childhood soft tissue sarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.  Treatment for childhood soft tissue sarcoma may cause side effects.  Eight types of standard treatment are used:  Surgery  Radiation therapy  Chemotherapy  Observation  Hormone therapy  Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs  Targeted therapy  Immunotherapy  New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.  Gene therapy  Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.  Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.  Followup tests may be needed.There are different types of treatment for patients with childhood soft tissue sarcoma.Different types of treatments are available for patients with childhood soft tissue sarcoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.Children with childhood soft tissue sarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with soft tissue sarcoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include a pediatric surgeon with special training in the removal of soft tissue sarcomas. The following specialists may also be included:  Pediatrician.  Radiation oncologist.  Pediatric hematologist.  Pediatric nurse specialist.  Rehabilitation specialist.  Psychologist.  Social worker.  Childlife specialist.Treatment for childhood soft tissue sarcoma may cause side effects.For information about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer, see our. Side. Effects page. Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Late effects of cancer treatment may include:  Physical problems.  Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.  Second cancers (new types of cancer). Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. (See the. PDQ summary on. Late. Effects of. Treatment for. Childhood. Cancer for more information.)Eight types of standard treatment are used:Surgery. Surgery to completely remove the soft tissue sarcoma is done when possible. If the tumor is very large, radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be given first, to make the tumor smaller and decrease the amount of tissue that needs to be removed during surgery. This is called neoadjuvant therapy. The following types of surgery may be used:  Wide local excision: Removal of the tumor along with some normal tissue around it.  Amputation: Surgery to remove all or part of the limb or appendage with cancer, such as the arm or hand.  Lymphadenectomy: Removal of the lymph nodes with cancer.  Mohs surgery: A surgical procedure used to treat cancer in the skin. Individual layers of cancer tissue are removed and checked under a microscope one at a time until all cancer tissue has been removed. This type of surgery is used to treat dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. It is also called. Mohs micrographic surgery.  Hepatectomy: Surgery to remove all or part of the liver. A second surgery may be needed to:  Remove any remaining cancer cells.  Check the area around where the tumor was removed for cancer cells and then remove more tissue if needed. If cancer is in the liver, a hepatectomy and liver transplant may be done (the liver is removed and replaced with a healthy one from a donor). Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy or chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. This type of radiation therapy may include the following:  Stereotactic body radiation therapy: Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy. Special equipment is used to place the patient in the same position for each radiation treatment. Once a day for several days, a radiation machine aims a larger than usual dose of radiation directly at the tumor. By having the patient in the same position for each treatment, there is less damage to nearby healthy tissue. This procedure is also called stereotactic externalbeam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy.  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated and whether the tumor was completely removed by surgery. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat childhood soft tissue sarcoma. Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is the use of more than one anticancer drug. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated. Most types of soft tissue sarcoma do not respond to treatment with chemotherapy. See. Drugs. Approved for. Soft. Tissue. Sarcoma for more information. Observation. Observation is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. Observation may be done when:  Complete removal of the tumor is not possible.  No other treatments are available.  The tumor is not likely to damage any vital organs. Hormone therapy. Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. Hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (receptors), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working. Antiestrogens (drugs that block estrogen), such as tamoxifen, may be used to treat desmoidtype fibromatosis. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are drugs (such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen) that are commonly used to decrease fever, swelling, pain, and redness. In the treatment of desmoidtype fibromatosis, an. NSAID called sulindac may be used to help block the growth of cancer cells. Targeted therapy. Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation do. Kinase inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy that block an enzyme called kinase (a type of protein). There are different types of kinases in the body that have different actions.  ALK inhibitors may stop the cancer from growing and spreading:  Crizotinib may be used to treat inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor.  Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) block signals needed for tumors to grow:  Imatinib is used to treat dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.  Pazopanib may be used to treat recurrent and progressive soft tissue sarcoma. It is being studied for many types of newly diagnosed soft tissue sarcoma.  Sorafenib may be used to treat desmoidtype fibromatosis. New types of tyrosine kinase inhibitors are being studied such as. LOXO101 and entrectinib for infantile fibrosarcoma. Other types of targeted therapy are being studied in clinical trials, including the following:  mTOR inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy that stops the protein that helps cells divide and survive. mTOR inhibitors are being studied to treat perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Sirolimus is a type of mTOR inhibitor therapy.  Angiogenesis inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy that prevent the growth of new blood vessels needed for tumors to grow. Angiogenesis inhibitors, such as cediranib, sunitinib, and thalidomide are being studied to treat alveolar soft part sarcoma and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Bevacizumab is being studied for blood vessel tumors.  Histone methyltransferase (HMT) inhibitors are targeted therapy drugs that work inside cancer cells and block signals needed for tumors to grow. HMT inhibitors are being studied for the treatment of epithelioid sarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, extrarenal (extracranial) rhabdoid tumor, extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, and synovial sarcoma.  Heatshock protein inhibitors block certain proteins that protect tumor cells and help them grow. Ganetespib is a heat shock protein inhibitor being studied in combination with the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors that cannot be removed by surgery.  Antibodydrug conjugates are made up of a monoclonal antibody attached to a drug. The monoclonal antibody binds to specific proteins or receptors found on certain cells, including cancer cells. The drug enters these cells and kills them without harming other cells. Lorvotuzumab mertansine is an antibodydrug conjugate being studied for the treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, and synovial sarcoma. See. Drugs. Approved for. Soft. Tissue. Sarcoma for more information. Immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight disease. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against disease. Interferon is a type of immunotherapy used to treat epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. It interferes with the division of tumor cells and can slow tumor growth.Followup tests may be needed.Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups.Treatment.

Question: How to diagnose Wilms Tumor and Other Childhood Kidney Tumors ?
Answer: Tests are used to screen for. Wilms tumor.Screening tests are done in children with an increased risk of. Wilms tumor. These tests may help find cancer early and decrease the chance of dying from cancer. In general, children with an increased risk of. Wilms tumor should be screened for. Wilms tumor every three months until they are at least 8 years old. An ultrasound test of the abdomen is usually used for screening. Small. Wilms tumors may be found and removed before symptoms occur. Children with. BeckwithWiedemann syndrome or hemihyperplasia are also screened for liver and adrenal tumors that are linked to these genetic syndromes. A test to check the alphafetoprotein (AFP) level in the blood and an ultrasound of the abdomen are done until the child is 4 years old. An ultrasound of the kidneys is done after the child is 4 years old. In children with certain gene changes, a different schedule for ultrasound of the abdomen may be used. Children with aniridia and a certain gene change are screened for. Wilms tumor every three months until they are 8 years old. An ultrasound test of the abdomen is used for screening. Some children develop. Wilms tumor in both kidneys. These often appear when. Wilms tumor is first diagnosed, but. Wilms tumor may also occur in the second kidney after the child is successfully treated for. Wilms tumor in one kidney. Children with an increased risk of a second. Wilms tumor in the other kidney should be screened for. Wilms tumor every three months for up to eight years. An ultrasound test of the abdomen may be used for screening.Tests that examine the kidney and the blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose. Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.The following tests and procedures may be used:  Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.  Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:  The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.  The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.  The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.  Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. This test is done to check how well the liver and kidneys are working.  Renal function test : A procedure in which blood or urine samples are checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood or urine by the kidneys. A higher or lower than normal amount of a substance can be a sign that the kidneys are not working as they should.  Urinalysis : A test to check the color of urine and its contents, such as sugar, protein, blood, and bacteria.  Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which highenergy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. An ultrasound of the abdomen is done to diagnose a kidney tumor.  CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine. A dye is injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.  MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium: A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).  Xray: An xray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body, such as the chest and abdomen.  PETCT scan : A procedure that combines the pictures from a positron emission tomography (PET) scan and a computed tomography (CT) scan. The. PET and. CT scans are done at the same time on the same machine. The pictures from both scans are combined to make a more detailed picture than either test would make by itself. A. PET scan is a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The. PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.  Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The decision of whether to do a biopsy is based on the following:  The size of the tumor.  The stage of the cancer.  Whether cancer is in one or both kidneys.  Whether imaging tests clearly show the cancer.  Whether the tumor can be removed by surgery.  Whether the patient is in a clinical trial. A biopsy may be done before any treatment is given, after chemotherapy to shrink the tumor, or after surgery to remove the tumor.

Question: How to diagnose Wilms Tumor and Other Childhood Kidney Tumors ?
Answer:   A physical exam and history may be done to diagnose. Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors. Imaging tests may also be used, such as ultrasound, CT scan, and. MRI.

Question: what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Urethral Cancer ?
Answer: New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.Information about clinical trials is available from the. NCI website.Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the. Treatment. Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from. NCI's listing of clinical trials.

The following tests and procedures may be used:  Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.  Physical exam of the nose, face, and neck: An exam in which the doctor looks into the nose with a small, longhandled mirror to check for abnormal areas and checks the face and neck for lumps or swollen lymph nodes.  Xrays of the head and neck: An xray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.  MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).  Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. There are three types of biopsy:  Fineneedle aspiration (FNA) biopsy : The removal of tissue or fluid using a thin needle.  Incisional biopsy : The removal of part of an area of tissue that doesnt look normal.  Excisional biopsy : The removal of an entire area of tissue that doesnt look normal.  Nasoscopy : A procedure to look inside the nose for abnormal areas. A nasoscope is inserted into the nose. A nasoscope is a thin, tubelike instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. A special tool on the nasoscope may be used to remove samples of tissue. The tissues samples are viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer.  Laryngoscopy : A procedure to look at the larynx (voice box) for abnormal areas. A mirror or a laryngoscope (a thin, tubelike instrument with a light and a lens for viewing) is inserted through the mouth to see the larynx.

Question: What are the stages of Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia ?
Answer: Key. Points. Once adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.  There is no standard staging system for adult. AML.Once adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.The extent or spread of cancer is usually described as stages. In adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the subtype of. AML and whether the leukemia has spread outside the blood and bone marrow are used instead of the stage to plan treatment. The following tests and procedures may be used to determine if the leukemia has spread:  Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal column. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the. CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid. The sample of. CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord. This procedure is also called an. LP or spinal tap.  CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of the abdomen, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.There is no standard staging system for adult. AML.The disease is described as untreated, in remission, or recurrent. Untreated adult. AML. In untreated adult. AML, the disease is newly diagnosed. It has not been treated except to relieve signs and symptoms such as fever, bleeding, or pain, and the following are true:  The complete blood count is abnormal.  At least 20% of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts (leukemia cells).  There are signs or symptoms of leukemia. Adult. AML in remission. In adult. AML in remission, the disease has been treated and the following are true:  The complete blood count is normal.  Less than 5% of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts (leukemia cells).  There are no signs or symptoms of leukemia in the brain and spinal cord or elsewhere in the body. Recurrent. Adult. AML. Recurrent. AML is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The. AML may come back in the blood or bone marrow.

Question: What are the stages of Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia ?
Answer:  Adult. Acute. Myeloid. Leukemia has different stages based on how many blasts are found in the blood and bone marrow: Stage 0: Also known as "hypoplastic," this stage has less than 5% blasts in the bone marrow. Stage 1: This stage has 5% to 25% blasts in the bone marrow. Stage 2: This stage has 25% to 50% blasts in the bone marrow. Stage 3: This stage has more than 50% blasts in the bone marrow. Stage 4: This stage includes extramedullary disease, meaning leukemia cells have spread outside the bone marrow.

Question: What are the symptoms of Pancreatic Cancer ?
Answer: Signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer include jaundice, pain, and weight loss. Pancreatic cancer may not cause early signs or symptoms. Signs and symptoms may be caused by pancreatic cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:  Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes).  Lightcolored stools.  Dark urine.  Pain in the upper or middle abdomen and back.  Weight loss for no known reason.  Loss of appetite.  Feeling very tired.Pancreatic cancer is difficult to detect (find) and diagnose early.Pancreatic cancer is difficult to detect and diagnose for the following reasons:  There arent any noticeable signs or symptoms in the early stages of pancreatic cancer.  The signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer, when present, are like the signs and symptoms of many other illnesses.  The pancreas is hidden behind other organs such as the stomach, small intestine, liver, gallbladder, spleen, and bile ducts.

Question: What are the symptoms of Pancreatic Cancer ?
Answer:  Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) Unexplained weight loss. Abdominal pain or discomfort. Loss of appetite. Nausea and vomiting. Fatigue. Pale or graycolored stools. Dark urine. Blood clots. Diabetes

Question: what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Plasma Cell Neoplasms (Including Multiple Myeloma) ?
Answer: New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the. NCI website. New combinations of therapies. Clinical trials are studying different combinations of biologic therapy, chemotherapy, steroid therapy, and drugs. New treatment regimens using thalidomide or lenalidomide are also being studied.Supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment.This therapy controls problems or side effects caused by the disease or its treatment, and improves quality of life. Supportive care is given to treat problems caused by multiple myeloma and other plasma cell neoplasms. Supportive care may include the following:  Plasmapheresis: If the blood becomes thick with extra antibody proteins and interferes with circulation, plasmapheresis is done to remove extra plasma and antibody proteins from the blood. In this procedure blood is removed from the patient and sent through a machine that separates the plasma (the liquid part of the blood) from the blood cells. The patient's plasma contains the unneeded antibodies and is not returned to the patient. The normal blood cells are returned to the bloodstream along with donated plasma or a plasma replacement. Plasmapheresis does not keep new antibodies from forming.  Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant: If amyloidosis occurs, treatment may include highdose chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplant using the patient's own stem cells.  Biologic therapy: Biologic therapy with thalidomide, lenalidomide, or pomalidomide is given to treat amyloidosis.  Targeted therapy: Targeted therapy with proteasome inhibitors is given to treat amyloidosis.  Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy is given for bone lesions of the spine.  Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy is given to reduce back pain from osteoporosis or compression fractures of the spine.  Bisphosphonate therapy: Bisphosphonate therapy is given to slow bone loss and reduce bone pain. See the following. PDQ summaries for more information on bisphosphonates and problems related to their use:  Cancer. Pain  Oral. Complications of. Chemotherapy and. Head/Neck. RadiationPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the. Treatment. Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from. NCI's listing of clinical trials.

Question: what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Plasma Cell Neoplasms (Including Multiple Myeloma) ?
Answer: Key. Points. Research and clinical trials for plasma cell neoplasms, including multiple myeloma, are ongoing to improve treatment outcomes and find new therapies. Some studies focus on targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and personalized medicine approaches for treating plasma cell neoplasms. Other clinical trials aim to improve detection methods, identify biomarkers for prognosis, and develop more effective combination treatments for patients.

Question: What are the symptoms of Wilms Tumor and Other Childhood Kidney Tumors ?
Answer: Signs of. Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors include a lump in the abdomen and blood in the urine. Sometimes childhood kidney tumors do not cause signs and symptoms and the parent finds a mass in the abdomen by chance or the mass is found during a wellchild health check up. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by kidney tumors or by other conditions. Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:  A lump, swelling, or pain in the abdomen.  Blood in the urine.  High blood pressure (headache, feeling very tired, chest pain, or trouble seeing or breathing).  Hypercalcemia (loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, weakness, or feeling very tired).  Fever for no known reason.  Loss of appetite.  Weight loss for no known reason. Wilms tumor that has spread to the lungs or liver may cause the following signs and symptoms:  Cough.  Blood in the sputum.  Trouble breathing.  Pain in the abdomen.

Question: What are the symptoms of Wilms Tumor and Other Childhood Kidney Tumors ?
Answer:  A lump or swelling in the abdomen. Blood in the urine. Fever for no known reason. High blood pressure. Aches and pains (in the abdomen, back, or side).

Question: What are the treatments for Childhood Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors ?
Answer: Key. Points. There are different types of treatment for children who have central nervous system (CNS) embryonal tumors.  Children who have. CNS embryonal tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating brain tumors in children.  Childhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years.  Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.  Five types of treatment are used:  Surgery  Radiation therapy  Chemotherapy  Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue  Targeted therapy  New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.  Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.  Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.  Followup tests may be needed.There are different types of treatment for children who have central nervous system (CNS) embryonal tumors.Different types of treatment are available for children with central nervous system (CNS) embryonal tumors. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.Children who have. CNS embryonal tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating brain tumors in children.Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with brain tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists:  Pediatrician.  Neurosurgeon.  Neurologist.  Neuropathologist.  Neuroradiologist.  Rehabilitation specialist.  Radiation oncologist.  Psychologist.Childhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years.Signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about signs or symptoms caused by the tumor that may continue after treatment.Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.Side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following:  Physical problems.  Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.  Second cancers (new types of cancer). Children diagnosed with medulloblastoma may have certain problems after surgery or radiation therapy such as changes in the ability to think, learn, and pay attention. Also, cerebellar mutism syndrome may occur after surgery. Signs of this syndrome include the following:  Delayed ability to speak.  Trouble swallowing and eating.  Loss of balance, trouble walking, and worsening handwriting.  Loss of muscle tone.  Mood swings and changes in personality. Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. (See the. PDQ summary on. Late. Effects of. Treatment for. Childhood. Cancer for more information).Five types of treatment are used:Surgery. Surgery is used to diagnose and treat a childhood. CNS embryonal tumor as described in the. General. Information section of this summary. Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of radiation therapy include the following:  Conformal radiation therapy: Conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3dimensional (3D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor. This allows a high dose of radiation to reach the tumor and causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue.  Stereotactic radiation therapy: Stereotactic radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy. A rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment. A machine aims radiation directly at the tumor, causing less damage to nearby healthy tissue. The total dose of radiation is divided into several smaller doses given over several days. This procedure is also called stereotactic externalbeam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy.  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. Radiation therapy to the brain can affect growth and development in young children. For this reason, clinical trials are studying new ways of giving radiation that may have fewer side effects than standard methods. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat childhood. CNS embryonal tumors. Because radiation therapy can affect growth and brain development in young children, especially children who are three years old or younger, chemotherapy may be given to delay or reduce the need for radiation therapy. Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated. Regular dose anticancer drugs given by mouth or vein to treat central nervous system tumors cannot cross the bloodbrain barrier and enter the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Instead, an anticancer drug is injected into the fluidfilled space to kill cancer cells that may have spread there. This is called intrathecal or intraventricular chemotherapy. Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue. Highdose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the bodys blood cells. Targeted therapy. Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. Signal transduction inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy used to treat recurrent medulloblastoma. Signal transduction inhibitors block signals that are passed from one molecule to another inside a cell. Blocking these signals may kill cancer cells. Vismodegib is a type of signal transduction inhibitor.New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.Information about clinical trials is available from the. NCI website.Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.

NCI's listing of clinical trials.Followup tests may be needed.Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. (See the. General. Information section for a list of tests.) Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. This is sometimes called restaging. Some of the imaging tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the brain tumor has recurred (come back). If the imaging tests show abnormal tissue in the brain, a biopsy may also be done to find out if the tissue is made up of dead tumor cells or if new cancer cells are growing. These tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups.Treatment. Options for. Childhood. Central. Nervous. System. Embryonal. Tumors and. Childhood. PineoblastomaNewly. Diagnosed. Childhood.

Question: Who is at risk for Skin Cancer? ?
Answer: Skin color and being exposed to sunlight can increase the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer and actinic keratosis. Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma include the following:  Being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (such as from tanning beds) over long periods of time.  Having a fair complexion, which includes the following:  Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.  Blue or green or other lightcolored eyes.  Red or blond hair.  Having actinic keratosis.  Past treatment with radiation.  Having a weakened immune system.  Having certain changes in the genes that are linked to skin cancer.  Being exposed to arsenic.

Question: Who is at risk for Skin Cancer? ?
Answer:  People at risk for skin cancer include: Individuals with fair skin, light hair, and light eyes. Those with a history of sunburns or excessive sun exposure. People with a family history of skin cancer. Individuals with a weakened immune system. Those who use tanning beds or sunlamps

Question: What is (are) Pituitary Tumors ?
Answer: Key. Points. A pituitary tumor is a growth of abnormal cells in the tissues of the pituitary gland.  The pituitary gland hormones control many other glands in the body.  Having certain genetic conditions increases the risk of developing a pituitary tumor.  Signs of a pituitary tumor include problems with vision and certain physical changes.  Imaging studies and tests that examine the blood and urine are used to detect (find) and diagnose a pituitary tumor.  Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.A pituitary tumor is a growth of abnormal cells in the tissues of the pituitary gland.Pituitary tumors form in the pituitary gland, a peasized organ in the center of the brain, just above the back of the nose. The pituitary gland is sometimes called the "master endocrine gland" because it makes hormones that affect the way many parts of the body work. It also controls hormones made by many other glands in the body. Pituitary tumors are divided into three groups:  Benign pituitary adenomas: Tumors that are not cancer. These tumors grow very slowly and do not spread from the pituitary gland to other parts of the body.  Invasive pituitary adenomas: Benign tumors that may spread to bones of the skull or the sinus cavity below the pituitary gland.  Pituitary carcinomas: Tumors that are malignant (cancer). These pituitary tumors spread into other areas of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) or outside of the central nervous system. Very few pituitary tumors are malignant. Pituitary tumors may be either nonfunctioning or functioning.  Nonfunctioning pituitary tumors do not make extra amounts of hormones.  Functioning pituitary tumors make more than the normal amount of one or more hormones. Most pituitary tumors are functioning tumors. The extra hormones made by pituitary tumors may cause certain signs or symptoms of disease.The pituitary gland hormones control many other glands in the body.Hormones made by the pituitary gland include:  Prolactin: A hormone that causes a womans breasts to make milk during and after pregnancy.  Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH): A hormone that causes the adrenal glands to make a hormone called cortisol. Cortisol helps control the use of sugar, protein, and fats in the body and helps the body deal with stress.  Growth hormone: A hormone that helps control body growth and the use of sugar and fat in the body. Growth hormone is also called somatotropin.  Thyroidstimulating hormone: A hormone that causes the thyroid gland to make other hormones that control growth, body temperature, and heart rate. Thyroidstimulating hormone is also called thyrotropin.  Luteinizing hormone (LH) and folliclestimulating hormone (FSH): Hormones that control the menstrual cycle in women and the making of sperm in men.

Question: What is (are) Pituitary Tumors ?
Answer:  Pituitary tumors are growths that develop in the pituitary gland, a small gland located at the base of the brain. There are different types of pituitary tumors, such as noncancerous (adenomas) and cancerous (carcinomas). Symptoms of pituitary tumors may include headaches, vision problems, hormonal imbalances, and more. Treatment options for pituitary tumors may include surgery, radiation therapy, and medication, depending on the type and size of the tumor.
